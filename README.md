## My Project - Papakura Brass

I have two things to note:

1. **W3C Markup**
   When I ran the HTML through W3C markup it gave my buttons 'errors' no matter which way I linked them. Whether I put the 'a' tag in the 'button' tag, or the other way around.

2. **Content**
   I also thought you'd like to know that the content of this project is real - although I used placeholder text for some parts.
